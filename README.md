React Infinite
==============

This is forked from seatgeek's https://github.com/seatgeek/react-infinite. This project exists because seatgeek has not yet updated to react 16.

The update process for the original react-infinite is reliant on lots of test changes.

See an open PR for updating to react 16:

https://github.com/seatgeek/react-infinite/pull/240

To make use of the library with react 16 in the meantime, I published this fork.

Be warned: this may not work as intended for all use cases, and all the tests have been deleted.
